_wall_seconds is the elapsed time of the AI stage; model_seconds sums each call's latency._ _the spending ceiling is checked before each call, so a run can pass it by the calls in flight (at most the investigators of the deepest depth)._

## Cost and speed per review

| Depth | Complete | Calls | No-call reviews | Tokens in | Tokens out | of which context | USD mean | USD median | USD p90 | Wall s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| auto | 30/30 | 5.0 | 0 | 329.9k | 7.3k | 0 | $0.4485 | $0.1980 | $1.07 | 51.8 |

Means over complete reviews. A review whose tokens or dollars the provider did not report is left out of those columns, and counted in the checklist below, never read as zero.

## Findings, catch and noise

| Depth | P0 / P1 / P2 | Caught | Catch rate (95% interval) | Unmatched | Noise rate (95% interval) | USD per catch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| auto | 0 / 7 / 67 | 0/0 | n/a | 0/0 (0 repeat a caught bug) | n/a | n/a |

Catch and noise are scored only on labelled pull requests, by the rules in the corpus (`match`). A finding catches a label by `location` (near a line the fix edited) or `symbol` (it names an identifier the fix edited); the per-pull-request tables say which. Noise is a finding that matches no label, so it is an upper bound on false positives wherever the labels are incomplete; some of it repeats a bug already caught (the same problem reported on two targets of one function).

## Follow-up pushes

| Depth | Pushes | Calls with carry-forward | Calls re-reviewing all | USD with carry-forward | USD re-reviewing all | Saved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| auto | 0 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

A push is the fix commit applied on top of the reviewed head. "Re-reviewing all" is what a per-push reviewer spends; "with carry-forward" is what this reviewer spends when it reuses the first review.

## Reference team (a projection)

10 developers, 300 pull requests a month, 1.2 reviews each. a projection from this report's mean cost per review and per push, not a quote and not a price.

| Depth | First review | Push (carry-forward) | Push (re-review all) | Month (carry-forward) | Month (re-review all) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| auto | $0.4485 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

## Is a number ready to publish?

**Cost per review: ready.**

**Catch and noise: not ready.**
- auto: 0 labelled pull requests scored; at least 8 are needed
- catch and noise are rates over a handful of pull requests; quote them with their intervals

**Head to head with the other reviewer: not ready.**
- 0 pull requests carry the other reviewer's comments; at least 8 are needed
- no baseline comment has a verdict, so its precision is unknown

Figures a cost-per-review sentence would be built from (only when the cost block above is ready):

| Depth | Reviews | Mean | Median | p90 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| auto | 30 | $0.4485 | $0.1980 | $1.07 |

Whatever is published:

- name the model and its price list date; the figure is for that model only
- state that it is the mean over this corpus, which is not the reader's code
- do not publish another reviewer's price from this report: it holds only what you supplied
